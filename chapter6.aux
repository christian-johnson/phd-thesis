The shape of the TS distribution is best-fit by a $\chi ^2$ distribution with only one degree of freedom, although the $\chi ^2$ distribution slightly underpredicts the true distribution at high TS. At the critical value of 2.71, the shape of the distribution is particularly well-described by the $\chi ^2$ distribution. {\it  Right Panel}: Correlation coefficients between the total flux of the DM signal hypotheses and the normalization $N$ of the GC source (modeled here as a power law, i.e. $\frac  {dN}{dE} = Ne^{-\alpha E}$. We evaluate the correlation as a function of the upper edge of the DM signal box, and find that the correlation is negligible for high-energy boxes but is becomes significant at lower energies because of the increased statistics in the data. Because the two sources are spatially coincident, the sources are expected to be anticorrelated. }}{42}}
